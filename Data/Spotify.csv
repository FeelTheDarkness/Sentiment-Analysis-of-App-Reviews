Just because you don't have a premium you have to listen tons of ads after literally every song. You can't even choose a song because it gives you an ad whatever song you click on & then proceeds to play song of it's own choice. At this point there are better chances of hearing the song you want to on radio. Would recommend YT music instead. Atleast I can hear what I want. Not some nonsense.,1

Outside of that, Spotify is terrible. The most glaring issue is that their audio quality is so bad it ruins music. If you are choosing music to put on in the background, this is perfectly adequate.

ff56434b-359b-4943-98da-055e137979fe,I just want to pop in for my semiannual complaints about this app. Reminder that Spotify is spending HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS of dollars per year paying podcast hosts but the listening experience is complete garbage. You still can't sort your downloaded episodes the way you want. You still get unskippable video ads on audio only podcasts. The New Episodes page has been deleted. Now you can't even open the settings on the Your Episodes page which won't delete downloads after you play them.,1

Not only that but ads are repetitive, what I mean by that is every song the next thing that'll pop up is an ad, I know that this is how the app persuades you to get premium but please lessen the income of the ads. Please remove these features and let the freebies enjoy their music FOR ONCE.",1

I am unable to shut off smart shuffle, and if I want to listen to a specific song, I have to hear ads first, and maybe a few songs that spotify recommends. Features that I assumed came with premium are available in free version - weekly playlists, song radio, etc. I am going to see what differences there are between the versions of YT music because paying 15 a month to turn off smart shuffle is ridiculous.",1

Why do you think I played a playlist? To listen to other songs? But spotify being spotify wants me to pay for every single thing.

I would recommend it, but if you have an apple device, go with apple Music instead.

Ads play after every 1 or 2 songs, skips are limited, you can't play specific songs, and shuffle is forced even in your own playlists. The app constantly pushes you to upgrade which gets really annoying. It feels like the free tier is designed to frustrate users into paying. If this is how the free experience is meant to be, it's just not worth using.",1

Spotify reinvents features sometimes and it makes the app harder to navigate/less intuitive for seemingly no reason. Smart shuffle replacing the enhance feature is an example of that. 2. They often break the app for a few days after every update. Idk if the devs are just not doing tests before pushing updates, but it does get old pretty quick. The issues I see tend to be widespread across many users/devices.",4

No warning when you are about to run out either, book just stops mid word. We should get to finish the chapter. This design is deliberately cutting books off without warning to manipulate us into buying more hours. $15.99AUD for 10 more hours. Audible cost $14.94AUD for full unlimited access to a whole book regardless of how long it is. Who is paying for more hours at that price??",1

But now for some reason when I click on a song I want to play it just randomly plays a ""suggested song in the shuffle thingy"" and not the song I want. I have to pay premium in order to remove this and without paying for me the app is basically unusable!!",1

I'll have to stop using Spotify altogether if this persists as an issue because I can not consistently afford premium. I don't know if that's just a me thing, but it's been driving me insane. And I use music for everything.",2
5bb36f89-4872-4bc8-8462-a9f9805e2f58,Why make your customers experience worse? Removing the podcast new episodes auto playlist is one of most user unfriendly things I've ever seen an app do. The homepage is horribly cluttered and now I have to use it to hunt down new episodes. Enshittification at its most annoying.,1

bba5bfda-557f-441e-82df-ae97a1ee7770,awful. horrible. on my phone (samsung) EVERYTHING is automatically on shuffle. I can't turn it off without premium. I can't enjoy my CUSTOM MADE PLAYLISTS how I want to because I need to pay just to play it how I MADE IT TO BE PLAYED. absolutely horrid. PC version is fine (as far as I've seen) but phone version? disgusting.,1

We can't replay a song, skip to certain part of the song, even if I try to play the song I lyk it plays a smtg else what's the use of search icon then? Leave the smart shuffle one but not being able to even listen to the song affording to my mood or taste really sucks and a another one we even need premium to peek wt the next song is? It's a Lil too much! An humble request to change.",5
