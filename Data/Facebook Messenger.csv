Do we really have to clear the cache every time just to use it? Voice notes won’t play unless you restart your phone or clear the cache again. And message delays are wild—sometimes they show up an hour late or not at all. Please fix this.",3

The app keeps getting heavier, slower, and bloated with features no one asked for. It’s frustrating to see zero actual benefits or optimizations, just flashy updates that serve no real purpose.

I see people online and I text them and don't get any responses and they are listed on my Facebook account friend list. You shouldn't have people online active that can't be completely connected to when they are texed to. They shouldn't be seen as active if they can't be reached.

This whole message encryption also make it worst,1

Videos calls are blurry vs Google Meet, which I guess uses less data? I already re-installed the app but the problem remains.

ca5049bd-35d5-4695-ae36-62260cdb27af,Not happy about being forced into having to install this if I wish to continue staying in touch with people. I was perfectly happy with the Messenger Lite version that doesn't eat away at all the space on the phone. Why discontinue a good thing? Especially when half of the reviews for Messenger are negative. Yet another big update. Still missing messenger lite. Maybe one of these giant updates could include an option to disable meta ai.,1
