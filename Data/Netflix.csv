What if two users are sharing an account and one of them absolutely does not have access to the other person's ""home WiFi"" or a TV???

Obviously it can be a second user logging in on a new device who would then have to approach the master user for the code every single time! Too bad, Netflix, this is a THIRD-CLASS experience!",1

Not everyone can afford this and all other OTT apps at the same time. If it was cheaper like other OTT platforms, we would think about it. At this price, we can buy many OTT apps and enjoy streaming. Even though if we purchase we are not going to watch series all days and so everyone think about before paying such high amount.Because we have lot otts and not even had time to watch that 2",1

I like the constant updates too but it would be better if you updated full collections at once. Some movies have several parts but only one or two are available. Instead of adding them one by one you should update the whole set at once. The price keeps increasing and it is starting to bother me because the range of series and movies feels incomplete.

bb0d50e9-8c67-4d7d-b602-a85227a42dfa,I just cancelled my membership. The new plans are ridiculous. I didn't sign up to a streaming service to PAY FOR ADS. Advertisers pay Netflix to show us the ads... and then they have the nerve to charge us to watch them (or pay extra to remove the ads). It's so greedy. They get paid twice to run their ads. I'm sick of these massive companies treating customers like cash machines.,1

Easy, reliable, safe, and user friendly. There's only one other app that out does Netflix. their service is free and has as close to as ""all"" or ""every"" title in movies and TV shows and that's Movie Box Pro. One has to download the APK for MBP to establish service usage but if you can get into MBP, that's where it's at but if you can't, then Netflix is the way",5

Cluttered with games and a big 60%+ screen image for suggested things I have no interest in watching with no means to customize, turn off, or disable. This is not a good user experience at all.

The content doesn't offer alot of new items and netflix originals are using cheaper actors that are unheard of. You dont raise costs because you lose viewers. Apple tv is only 9.99 a month I'm discontinuing services before it renews and before they raise prices yet again. I am absolutely disgusted with netflix after 7 years of being a loyal customer!,1

Sometimes when the connection is poor the quality adjusts automatically and there's no icons to choose what quality you prefer so the visual quality naturaly becomes poor which affects the watching experience and I had wished there's 2x fast forward for scenes I don't like much. Also no screenshots! seriously? too much ~_~ I at least pay you know.,3

54ae5103-99dd-47fa-b78e-ecdb7e3dae51,This app does not like if you have dark mode or night light on. it will freak out and either not play videos if you have these settings on. Or it will straight up mess up your visual settings and disable dark mode / night light if you have them enabled and completely prevent you from re-enabling them (unless you restart your phone).,1

Then I'm trying to change my plan to ads they want a payment before I do it. No ma'am makes no sense. Come on Netflix the increases gone have people getting HULU or Philo because 17.99 closer to almost 25.00. Give more incentives for being a customer and offer a grace period of maybe 2 weeks only,2
