37bf5a05-8f76-4d90-8c31-39e692ebe7d0,"Awful. Canceled subscription over a year ago. App was not adding content I would watch. No new Dub anime, no new series or seasons. And has anyone heard anyone talk about any new show worth subscribing again to watch it, NO. Just not as good as it was 4 years ago. Still nothing I like to watch. It's more for women and others that like feminine entertainment. Not much manly content added ever. To many other apps to just use this one.",1

I like the constant updates too but it would be better if you updated full collections at once. Some movies have several parts but only one or two are available. Instead of adding them one by one you should update the whole set at once. The price keeps increasing and it is starting to bother me because the range of series and movies feels incomplete.

e525a8db-48c8-4a33-82d0-5ac7294dc76d,Would love Netflix way more but they've gotten greedier and haven't improved the quality of the app. Charging more for a subscription while the app doesn't improve is not cool for me personally. also Netflix constantly removes amazing shows to make place for low budget shows no one likes. Still grateful for the wide range of things to pick from though!!,4

ce847699-97dd-4012-bd08-eb460ea73d3d,"why does netflix purchase rights to games and leave them without any updates!? sending messages to customer support doesn't help because you don't talk with developers but just with some random dude that says he will pass it on to developers and feels like nothing actually happens. the games are fun without ads but honestly, without support better avoid so you don't end up wasting time. I'm curious if I'll ever get reply and if someone will be willing to do something about it...doubt it",1

The content doesn't offer alot of new items and netflix originals are using cheaper actors that are unheard of. You dont raise costs because you lose viewers. Apple tv is only 9.99 a month I'm discontinuing services before it renews and before they raise prices yet again. I am absolutely disgusted with netflix after 7 years of being a loyal customer!,1

677121ed-697a-48e7-9507-da2decee4435,If you are an Anime lover then Netflix is for you. You like to watch documentaries. Netflix is for you. You love K-Dramas. Netflix is best for you. You love to watch Hollywood Movies/Series. This is the OTT you need. Original Western Movies and Western Series. Netflix ✅ I am an Indian but I don't watch Indian content that much now (except SRK and Netflix has a bunch of SRK movies). Netflix has good Indian content collection too though their original works are not up to the mark in most cases.,5

79aecb48-d30e-44ae-9709-83f2ded651f1,my wife and I have had Netflix since the beginning and I'm a trucker and after 20 plus years suddenly I need a traveling code. no Netflix I don't. since you can't respect truck drivers and want to punish me for changing locations. and since you're also the most expensive streaming service. I'm done with Netflix period I will not be treated like a criminal,1

2ef8c12a-bc61-42c8-8a9f-dce745b54de9,show quality vs price is a no brainer free apps offer much more shows aren't that And only had 1 new movie or show I would watch every 6 months not worth it at all. Thanks Disney Hulu for 2.99 a month . plus you added WWE raw cool until McMahon decided to ruin my families educational future so I can't just give them my money anymore.,1

Like they offer just enough seasons/episodes to get you hooked and then just leave you hanging. Like for jjk they only offer 1 season. and the worst thing is that they have enough money to license all the seasons. I would like it if they get all of the seasons of anime or get none at all cos its really frustrating! and also it would be cherry on top if they can get Attack on Titan!!,3

Then I'm trying to change my plan to ads they want a payment before I do it. No ma'am makes no sense.
