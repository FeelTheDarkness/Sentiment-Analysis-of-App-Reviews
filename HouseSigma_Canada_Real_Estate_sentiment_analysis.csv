"great app, but filtering could be better. I have 2 suggestions regarding the filtering. 1- Add an option to exclude those properties that we already marked as Not Interested so they won't be shown in the list/map view. 2- Same as website, filtering by front lot size could be more precise. In the website, we can choose more than 35 feet, but in the app, it's either 30 or 40 feet. Then I will for sure change my rating to 5 starts.
