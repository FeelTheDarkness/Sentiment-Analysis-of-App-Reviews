"Extremely poorly designed app. You need to force sellers to give ONE accurate number for square footage across the listing. Add this as a filter so we can filter out the garbage. I want to remove anything lower than 900 sqft. with two bedrooms? These aren't places to live in, just bad investments that shouldn't be rewarded. Realtors and sellers are misleading buyers and waste time by forcing an inquiry because of this. This app is meant to only help sellers, and not buyers.",1,2025-01-03 22:01:11,Google Play,NEGATIVE,-0.9997503161430359,"['extremely poorly designed app', 'sellers', 'one accurate number', 'square footage', 'the listing', 'a filter', 'the garbage', '900 sqft', 'two bedrooms', 'places', 'just bad investments', 'realtors', 'sellers', 'buyers', 'time', 'an inquiry', 'this app', 'sellers', 'not buyers']"
