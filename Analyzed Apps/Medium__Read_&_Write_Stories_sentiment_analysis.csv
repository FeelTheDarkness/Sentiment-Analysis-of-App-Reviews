"TLDR: fix the all-caps glitch, make it simpler to return a published story to draft form, allow ‚Äúselect‚Äù tool to copy more than one graph at a time ‚Ä¶ then it‚Äôs fantastic. 

I do love being able to do so much of my work from these teensy handheld computers‚Äîwrite and edit while waiting for soccer practice to end or from the stairclimber! So thank you. I do appreciate this app. However there are frustrating glitches such as the ALL CAPS glitch, where for unknown reasons all text appears capitalized. Also I once accidentally published a story. I needed to make the story not public but the only option from the app was to delete the story entirely. OK, I figured I would ‚Äúselect all‚Äù and copy my text into notes and delete then paste the draft back together from my notebook, but the app only allows you to select one graph at a time. So I would have had to copy paste like a hundred paragraphs.

"Mr Davies, like most of the materialist scientists today, cannot commit to an entangled universe- even when quantum mechanics has repeatedly proven that all questions cannot be answered with material formulas and principles. 

The universe and all it contains, whether as cosmology or physics, has, since time immemorial exhibited BOTH ‚Äòmatter‚Äô and metaphysical phenomena, an accepted and documented fact so obvious as to make the contemporary flailings of physicists outright juvenile!!

We know incontrovertibly that the Copenhagen Interpretation told us over 100 years ago that ALL things that exist are complementary in nature - equal and opposite aspects in the SAME entity- 3 well known physicists won the Nobel in physics verifying this  uni-versal condition. 

Metaphysics includes the existence of a transcendent intelligence. We, HOMA sapiens, are an integral part, ( again, verified by the Copenhagen) and Davies cannot muster the fortitude to make this admission - content to sit on the fence of noncommittal ‚Äòscience.‚Äô 

A remarkable theory is scheduled for publication late this year(‚Äò25) describing and explaining the creation of the Hydrogen atom- the fundamental unit of the uni-verse.
